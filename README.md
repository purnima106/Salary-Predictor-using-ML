# Salary-Predictor-using-ML
A salary predictor project built using ML. Just need to enter Years of Experience and let Machine Learning do the rest for Salary prediction. Also the project has been converted to exe i.e deployed from py file.
I tried to upload the output Application as well but its size is 86 mb and github supports only 25 mb
-the steps to convert python file to exe as simple:
-in cmd of that project we are supposed to run the following commands
pip auto-py-to=exe
auto-py-to-exe
